# MuRAT
Attenuation tomography code. 

PROGRAM MuRAT for Multi-resolution attenuation tomography analysis.

PROGRAM FOR: 3D direct- and 2D peak delay and coda-wave (with and without kernels) attenuation tomography

PROGRAM ARCHITECTURE: This release works in Matlab. Necessary toolboxes are: Signal Processing and Mapping Toolboxes (for latitute-longitude coordinates).

Two sample datasets (Mount St. Helens and Romania) have to be downloaded before running the code. They can be found as zipped folders at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.893893

Two other sample inputs are provided for the Tirreno Sea and Pollino area. The dataset may be requested to Luca De Siena.
